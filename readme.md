## Intro

The source of lesson taken from [AsmTutor][asmtutor].

The assembly used is [Flat Assembler (FASM)][fasmSite]

The original lesson is in NASM but this lesson files are adapted to FASM.

## Compile

Using FASM is fairly straightforward. Simply invoking the `fasm file`
is enough to compile and just run the resulting executable with `./file`.

For example:

```bash
$ fasm lesson01.asm
$ ./lesson01
# will print
Hello world!
segmentation fault
```

## Lesson Architecture

This lessons are using the 32-bit arch but with decent Linux it would
be run no problem.
