## Intro

The source of lesson taken from [AsmTutor][asmtutor].

The assembly used is [Flat Assembler (FASM)][fasmSite]

The original lesson is in NASM but this lesson files are adapted to FASM.

## Compile

Using FASM is fairly straightforward. Simply invoking the `fasm file`
is enough to compile and just run the resulting executable with `./file`.

For example:

```bash
$ fasm lesson01.asm
$ ./lesson01
# will print
Hello world!
segmentation fault
```

----
### Win64
To compile on Windows 64 bit, will from now on called as Win64, we must put the
`fasm.exe` available on the `PATH` global environment. Additionally, fasm needs
the global variable `INCLUDE` to where the include folder where fasm is extracted.  

For example we just put our fasm extraction on `c:\fasm`, at this stage we still
don't have the `fasm.exe` in the `PATH` so we can add it temporarily during
this particular cmd session.

```cmd
> set PATH=%PATH%;c:\fasm
> set INCLUDE=c:\fasm\include
> fasm
flat assembler  version 1.73.24
usage: fasm <source> [output]
optional settings:
 -m <limit>         set the limit in kilobytes for the available memory
 -p <limit>         set the maximum allowed number of passes
 -d <name>=<value>  define symbolic variable
 -s <file>          dump symbolic information for debugging
```

If we have the output as shown above, we can use `fasm.exe` as simple as
Linux example above.

## Lesson Architecture

The original lessons are giving example using `int 80h` for Linux32 but
this notes is adapted to both Linux32 and Linux64.  
For any decent linux, the notes examples for Linux32 are still able to
be compiled and ran even the host machine is Linux64.

Avoid using `rcx` and `r11` when calling `syscall` for Linux64 because
both of register are implicitly used as return address and flags subsequently.
[Ref][so-answer-rcx].

----
### Win64
For Windows 64 bit, abbreviated as Win64, the lessons are using Win32 [index][win32-api-index]
instead of `syscall` because there's no reliable documentation available
freely. There's some book which explains the internals, [Windows Internal Books][win-internal],
but as mentioned before, it's not available for free. Hence we use the
available [Windows API][win32-api-index].
